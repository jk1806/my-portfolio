# 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide - Get Your Shareable Link

## Your Portfolio Repository
**GitHub:** https://github.com/jk1806/my-portfolio

## ⚡ Fastest Way to Deploy (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub (if not already done)
Open PowerShell or Git Bash in `J:\Portfolio` and run:
```bash
git push origin main
```
*(You may need to enter your GitHub credentials)*

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
I've opened the Vercel deployment page in your browser. If it didn't open, go to:

**👉 https://vercel.com/new?import=https://github.com/jk1806/my-portfolio**

Then:
1. **Sign in** with your GitHub account (jk1806)
2. Click **"Import"** next to `jk1806/my-portfolio`
3. Click **"Deploy"** (keep all default settings)
4. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Step 3: Get Your Shareable Link! 🎉
After deployment, you'll see a URL like:
- `https://my-portfolio-jk1806.vercel.app`

**This is your shareable link!** Copy it and share with anyone.

## ✅ After Deployment
- Your portfolio will be live at the Vercel URL
- Any updates you push to GitHub will auto-deploy
- The link works on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If code isn't on GitHub yet:**
1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub
2. Try: `git push origin main` in terminal
3. Or use GitHub Desktop to push

**If Vercel deployment fails:**
- Make sure the GitHub repo has code
- Check that you're signed into Vercel with the same GitHub account
