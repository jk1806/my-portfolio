# Linux Kernel Development

## Overview
Learning and working on Linux kernel development - device drivers, kernel internals, memory management.

**Current focus**: Character device drivers and memory management

## Key Areas

### Kernel Internals
- Process and thread management
- Memory management (page allocator, slab allocator, vmalloc)
- System calls implementation
- Interrupt handling and bottom halves
- Kernel synchronization primitives
- Virtual file system (VFS)

### Device Drivers
- Character device drivers
- Block device drivers
- Network device drivers
- Platform device drivers
- Device Tree integration
- Driver model and bus subsystems

### Kernel Modules
- Loadable kernel modules (LKM)
- Module initialization and cleanup
- Module parameters
- Symbol export/import
- Module dependencies

### Kernel Debugging
- Kernel debugging techniques
- printk and dynamic debug
- Kernel oops analysis
- Core dumps and crash analysis
- ftrace and perf profiling
- KASAN and other sanitizers

### File Systems
- VFS layer understanding
- File system implementation
- Block I/O layer
- Page cache management

## Technologies
- Linux Kernel (5.x, 6.x)
- Device Drivers
- Kernel Modules
- Device Tree
