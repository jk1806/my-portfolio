# Board Support Package (BSP) Development

## Overview
Comprehensive BSP development expertise covering hardware abstraction layers, device tree configurations, and platform-specific implementations.

## Key Areas

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- GPIO configuration and management
- Clock and power management
- Interrupt controller setup
- Memory controller initialization
- Peripheral register access

### Device Tree Support
- Device tree source (DTS) files
- Device tree blob (DTB) compilation
- Device tree overlays
- Runtime device tree modifications

### Platform Initialization
- Early boot initialization
- CPU and core setup
- Cache and MMU configuration
- Board-specific hardware setup

## Technologies
- ARM Cortex-M/A architectures
- Device Tree (DTS/DTB)
- HAL implementations
- Platform-specific drivers
- Bootloader integration
