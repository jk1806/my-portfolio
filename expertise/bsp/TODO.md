# BSP TODO List

## High Priority
- [ ] Add DMA support for UART and SPI
- [ ] Implement power management for low power modes
- [ ] Add watchdog timer HAL
- [ ] Test GPIO interrupt handling

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Optimize clock configuration code
- [ ] Add support for alternate pin functions
- [ ] Document all HAL functions properly
- [ ] Add unit tests for HAL functions

## Low Priority
- [ ] Refactor device tree examples
- [ ] Add more platform-specific code
- [ ] Performance profiling

## Notes
- Clock config is working but needs optimization
- SPI mode 3 needs more testing
- Need to check cache coherency issues
